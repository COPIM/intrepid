            <p>1. The Providers publish academic books and other learned publications on an open access basis and/or
                provide infrastructure to support the publication and dissemination of open access books. OBC has
                developed an online platform through which the Providers are able to seek financial support for their
                publishing and/or infrastructural activities.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>2. Each Provider has created an individual Supporter Scheme to support the Provider&rsquo;s activities
                within the open access monograph publishing ecosystem. The Supporter Scheme reflects the Providers&rsquo;
                aims and ethos. By subscribing to this scheme, institutions will be supporting those aims and ethos.</p>
            <p>3. OBC includes a subscription service; the &lsquo;OBC Supporter Service&rsquo;, through which
                institutions can subscribe to Supporter Schemes in order to support the work of their chosen Providers.
                This can be done via the OBC platform or via direct correspondence. </p>
            <p>4.&nbsp;Each Provider has appointed OBC to collect the Supporter Contribution on its behalf.</p>
            <p>5.&nbsp;The terms of this Agreement and each Provider&rsquo;s supporter offer were negotiated and agreed

                expires or is terminated in accordance with Clause 5 (Term and Termination).</p>
            <p>2.4&nbsp;OBC enters into the Agreement as agent on behalf of the relevant Provider insofar as the
                Agreement purports to create any rights or obligations for the Provider. OBC enters into the Agreement
